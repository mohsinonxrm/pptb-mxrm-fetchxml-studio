# Changelog

All notable changes to FetchXML Studio will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### ⬆️ Upgraded

- **`@pptb/types` 1.0.7 → 1.2.0** — now the authoritative source for all PPTB host API types (`window.dataverseAPI`, `window.toolboxAPI`). Added to `tsconfig.app.json` `types` array so global augmentations apply project-wide without per-file triple-slash references.
- **`features.minAPI`** set to `"1.2.0"` in `package.json` to enforce the correct PPTB host version at install time.

### ✨ Added

#### Native File Save Dialog
- Both export paths (local ExcelJS export and Dataverse `ExportToExcel` action) now use `window.toolboxAPI.fileSystem.saveFile` when running inside the PPTB desktop host, presenting a native OS save-file dialog instead of a forced browser blob download.
- Graceful fallback to browser blob/anchor download when running in standalone or dev context (i.e. when `window.toolboxAPI` is not available).

#### Connection Environment Awareness
- `PptbContext` now exposes `environment?: "Dev" | "Test" | "UAT" | "Production"` sourced from the active `DataverseConnection`.
- Subscribes to `connection:updated`, `connection:created`, and `connection:deleted` PPTB events to keep the field in sync dynamically.

#### Package Manifest Hardening
- Added top-level `"icon"` field pointing to `icons/icon.svg` (replacing deprecated `configurations.iconUrl`).
- `"features"` block added: `{ "multiConnection": "none", "minAPI": "1.2.0" }`.
- `cspExceptions` migrated from plain-string arrays to the required object format with `domain` + `exceptionReason` fields (+ `optional: true` on style-src).
- Added `"validate": "pptb-validate"` npm script for pre-publish manifest validation.
- Added `"finalize-package": "npm run build && npm shrinkwrap"` convenience script.

### ♻️ Refactored

#### `pptbClient.ts`
- Removed the entire hand-written `declare global { interface Window { dataverseAPI?: { ... } } }` block (~60 lines). The `window.dataverseAPI` global is now typed entirely by `@pptb/types`.
- Added local `DataverseFetchXmlResponse` interface to capture OData response annotations beyond what `@pptb/types` `FetchXmlResult` declares (`@Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.totalrecordcount`, `morerecords`, `pagingcookie`, `totalrecordcountlimitexceeded`). These are OData wire annotations returned directly by Dataverse — not fabricated by PPTB — so the cast is safe at runtime.
- `downloadBase64File()` changed from `void` to `async Promise<void>`; uses `fileSystem.saveFile` when available.

#### `usePptbContext.ts`
- Removed the entire hand-written `declare global { interface Window { toolboxAPI?: { ... } } }` block. The `window.toolboxAPI` global is now typed entirely by `@pptb/types`.
- `PptbContext` interface: removed legacy `organizationId?: string` (not present in `DataverseConnection` v1.2.0 types); replaced with `environment?: "Dev" | "Test" | "UAT" | "Production"`.

#### `excelExport.ts`
- `downloadExcelFile()` changed from `void` to `async Promise<void>`; uses `fileSystem.saveFile` when available.

#### `AppShell.tsx`
- Both download call sites updated with `await` to match the new async signatures.

### 🔧 Technical

- TypeScript strict compile: **zero errors** (`tsc -b --noEmit`).
- `pptb-validate`: **✔ Validation passed**.

### ✨ Added

#### Select Attributes Dialog (#12)
- **Bulk Attribute Selection**: New "Select Attributes" modal dialog for efficient multi-attribute selection
  - Accessible from entity and link-entity context menus in the tree view
  - Works on root entity, link-entities, and nested link-entities at any level
